# Loki-Responsive-Website

Loki. is a static, responsive multi-page mock landing site for a fictional cloud hosting platform. It includes a homepage with a demo request form and showcase sections, a features page highlighting service cards with icons, and a docs page structured like developer documentation with navigable side sections and install snippets. Built with semantic HTML, reusable utility and style CSS, Font Awesome icons, grid/flex layouts, and placeholder content, it simulates a modern hosting provider’s marketing and onboarding experience.
